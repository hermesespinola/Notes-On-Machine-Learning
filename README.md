# Notes Machine Learning
This repository contains notes retrieved from [CS 229: Machine Learning (Course handouts)](http://cs229.stanford.edu/materials.html) as well as my solutions for Stanford's Machine Learning course assignments programmed in Octave 4.0.2.

## Machine Learning Honor Code

We strongly encourage students to form study groups, and discuss the lecture videos (including in-video questions). We also encourage you to get together with friends to watch the videos together as a group. However, the answers that you submit for the review questions should be your own work. For the programming exercises, you are welcome to discuss them with other students, discuss specific algorithms, properties of algorithms, etc.; we ask only that you not look at any source code written by a different student, nor show your solution code to other students.
